                <p>I'm a current full-stack web development student at the University of Arizona coding bootcamp.
                Expected to complete the boot camp in May 2021. I'm currently in the market for a job in web development;
                more specifically work that involved front-end web development, database administration, or React.js.
            </p>
                <p>I'm an Arizona native with a passion for coding, science, and video games.</p>
                <p></p>
